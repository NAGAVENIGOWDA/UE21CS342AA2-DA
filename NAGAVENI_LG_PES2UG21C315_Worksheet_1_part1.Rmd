## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
getwd()
```


```{r}
library(readxl)


# Read Excel file
data <- read_excel("C:/Users/Praka/OneDrive/Documents/5thSem/DA/moviedataset.xlsx")

```
Note that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Problem 1: Get the summary statistics (mean, median, min, max, 1st quartile, 3rd quartile and standard deviation). Calculate these only for the
numerical columns. What can you determine from the summary statistics? What summary statistics can be useful for categorical columns? Classify
all the variables/columns into their types of data attributes (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio).

Summary:

```{r}
summary(data)

```


Numerical columns summary:

```{r}
numerical_columns <- c("budget", "popularity", "revenue", "runtime", "vote_average", "vote_count")
summary_stats <- data.frame(
 Mean = sapply(data[numerical_columns], mean),
 Median = sapply(data[numerical_columns],median),
 Min = sapply(data[numerical_columns], min),
 Max = sapply(data[numerical_columns], max),
 Q1 = sapply(data[numerical_columns], quantile, probs = 0.25),
 Q3 = sapply(data[numerical_columns], quantile, probs = 0.75),
 SD = sapply(data[numerical_columns], sd)
)
print(summary_stats)
```
These summary statistics provide insights into central tendency, spread, and distribution of the data for each numerical variable. They can help you
understand the general characteristics of the dataset and identify potential outliers or patterns.

The statistics can be useful for categorical columns are:Frequency Counts, Mode,Percentage/Proportion,Bar Plot,Cross-Tabulation,Chi-Square
Test,Entropy or Gini Index and Cluster Analysis.

Classification of each column into its data attribute type: 1)budget: Ratio
2)genres: Nominal 3)id: Nominal 4)original_language: Nominal 5)popularity: Ratio or Interval 6)release_date: Interval 7)revenue: Ratio 8)runtime:
Ratio or Interval 9)title: Nominal 10)vote_average: Interval or Ratio 11)vote_count: Ratio 12)director: Nominal

Problem 2:
Investigate the data set for missing values. Also classify the missingness as MCAR, MAR or MNAR. Recommend ways to replace missing values
in the dataset and apply them for revenue, budget and runtime columns. Hint: Make sure to capture data from both, missing values in numeric
fields and empty strings in descriptive fields. Convert all missing placeholders to type NA. Look at the distribution of the dataset to classify the type of missing values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Replace empty strings with NA
data[data == ""] <- NA

# Loop through columns
for (col in colnames(data)) {
  if (is.numeric(data[[col]])) {
    # Replace 0s with NA, including handling missing values
    data[[col]][data[[col]] == 0] <- NA
  }
}

# Calculate missing counts and percentages
missing_counts <- colSums(is.na(data))
missing_percent <- missing_counts / nrow(data) * 100

# Create a data frame to store missing info
missing_info <- data.frame(Column = names(missing_counts), MissingCount = missing_counts, MissingPercent = missing_percent)

# Print the missing info
print(missing_info)

```
```{r}
missing_info <- data.frame(
 Column = c("budget", "genres", "id", "original_language", "popularity", "release_date", "revenue", "runtime", 
"title", "vote_average", "vote_count", "director"),
 MissingCount = c(599, 28, 0, 0, 1, 1, 778, 37, 0, 63, 62, 36),
 MissingPercent = c(14.82306360, 0.69289780, 0.00000000, 0.00000000, 0.02474635, 0.02474635, 19.25266023, 0.91561495, 0.00000000, 1.55902004, 1.53427369, 0.89086860)
)
median_missing_percent <- median(missing_info$MissingPercent)
mean_missing_percent <- mean(missing_info$MissingPercent)
if (median_missing_percent == 0) {
 missingness_classification <- "MCAR"
} else if (median_missing_percent > 0 && median_missing_percent <= mean_missing_percent) {
 missingness_classification <- "MAR"
} else {
 missingness_classification <- "MNAR"
}
cat("Missingness is classified as:", missingness_classification)
```
Ways to replace missing values in the dataset and apply them for revenue, budget and runtime columns:Mean or Median Imputation,Regression
Imputation,K-Nearest Neighbors Imputation.

```{r}
# Median imputation
data$revenue[is.na(data$revenue)] <- median(data$revenue, na.rm = TRUE)
data$budget[is.na(data$budget)] <- median(data$budget, na.rm = TRUE)
data$runtime[is.na(data$runtime)] <- median(data$runtime, na.rm = TRUE)
missing_counts <- colSums(is.na(data))
missing_percent <- missing_counts / nrow(data) * 100
missing_info <- data.frame(Column = names(missing_counts), MissingCount = missing_counts, MissingPercent = missing_percent)
print(missing_info)

```
```{r}

```

Problem 3:
Analyze the spread of the data set along years. How number of movie releases have changed over the years ?

```{r}
data$release_date <- as.Date(data$release_date,format = "%Y-%m-%d")
data$release_year <- lubridate::year(data$release_date)
release_counts <- table(data$release_year)
plot(release_counts, type = "l", xlab = "Year", ylab = "Number of Movie Releases", main = "Number of Movie Releas
es Over Years")



```
```{r}
barplot(release_counts, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Number of Movie Releases", main = "Number of Movie Releases Over Y
ears")
```
```{r}

```

Problem 4:
Create a horizontal box plot using the column “runtime”. What inferences can you make from this box and whisker plot? Comment on the skew of
the runtime field (visual inspection is enough).

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = runtime)) +
 geom_boxplot() +
 labs(x = "Runtime")
```
From the boxplot we can tell that runtime is positively skewed.

Problem 5:

Analyze the top 20 titles with highest budget, revenue and ROI. Plot a horizontal bar graph for all three metrics in each case. What analysis can
you make by looking at these graphs? What kind of movies attracts the highest investments and do they promise a better ROI ?

```{r}
data$roi <- (data$revenue - data$budget) / data$budget
# Sort data by budget, revenue, and ROI
top_budget <- head(data[order(-data$budget), ], 20)
top_revenue <- head(data[order(-data$revenue), ], 20)
top_roi <- head(data[order(-data$roi), ], 20)
plot_horizontal_bar <- function(df, x_col, y_col, title) {
 df <- df[order(-df[[x_col]]), ] # Reorder the data frame
 ggplot(df, aes(x = !!sym(x_col), y = reorder(!!sym(y_col), -!!sym(x_col)))) +
 geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "dodgerblue") +
 labs(x = x_col, y = y_col, title = title) +
 theme_minimal() 
}
# Plot horizontal bar graphs
plot_budget <- plot_horizontal_bar(top_budget, x_col = "budget", y_col = "title", title = "Top 20 Titles by Budge
t")
plot_revenue <- plot_horizontal_bar(top_revenue, x_col = "revenue", y_col = "title", title = "Top 20 Titles by Re
venue")
plot_roi <- plot_horizontal_bar(top_roi, x_col = "roi", y_col = "title", title = "Top 20 Titles by ROI")
# Display the bar graphs
print(plot_budget)
```
```{r}
print(plot_roi)
```

```{r}
print(plot_revenue)
```

The top budget titles may not always guarantee the highest revenue or ROI. While high budgets can contribute to impressive visuals and
production quality, the overall success of a movie depends on multiple factors.

The movies with high revenue are likely to include well-established franchises, popular characters, and successful adaptations that attract large audiences.

High ROI movies demonstrate that a well-crafted story, creative marketing, and audience engagement can result in significant profits even with
limited resources.

Movies with higher investment do not necessarily have to have higher ROI.

Problem 6:

Put yourself in the shoes of a production house. You want to produce the next big blockbuster. Plot the ROI, revenue and budget across genres to
finalize the genre of your upcoming movie as you did in the previous problem. Elaborate your answers with proper explanation. Since one movie
can fall in multiple genre categories, you are free to choose a combination. You can also understand how the popularity of different genres have changed along the years. Do provide a nice name to your movie and your dream cast ;)

```{r}
# Convert the space-separated string of genres to a list of genres for each movie
data$genres <- strsplit(data$genres, " ")
# Extract the individual genres and count their occurrences
label_counts <- table(unlist(data$genres)) # label_counts will be a data frame with "Var1" and "Freq" columns
# Sort the counts in descending order
label_counts <- sort(label_counts, decreasing = TRUE)
data$roi <- (data$revenue - data$budget) / data$budget
# Create scatter plots for ROI vs Revenue and Budget vs Revenue
scatter_roi <- ggplot(data, aes(x = roi, y = revenue)) +
 geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
 labs(x = "ROI", y = "Revenue", title = "ROI vs Revenue") +
 theme_minimal()
scatter_budget <- ggplot(data, aes(x = budget, y = revenue)) +
 geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
 labs(x = "Budget", y = "Revenue", title = "Budget vs Revenue") +
 theme_minimal()
# Display scatter plots
print(scatter_roi)
```

```{r}
print(scatter_budget)
```

Based on the given information with respect to roi are horror and dramas which will produce maximum value of production and are prefered the
evolving of movies have gone from more of romcom family dramas to more scifi high cost valuation movies.

A movie that I would like to make right now would be “Quiet Place” cast would be John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, the director Christopher Nolan
































## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
