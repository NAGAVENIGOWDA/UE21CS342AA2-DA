## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

One Way Anova:

```{r}

library(readxl)

data <- read_excel("C:/Users/Praka/OneDrive/Documents/5thSem/DA/students.xlsx")
str(data)
```

```{r}
# Install and load necessary packages
if (!requireNamespace("tidyverse", quietly = TRUE)) {
install.packages("tidyverse")
}
if (!requireNamespace("moments", quietly = TRUE)) {
install.packages("moments")
}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
library(moments)
```
Problem 1:

Read the data set and display the box plot for each of the fitness plans A, B, C, D. Analyze the box plot for outliers.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

boxplot(data$A, data$B, data$C, data$D, 
 names = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
 main = "Box Plots for Fitness Plans A, B, C, D",
 xlab = "Fitness Plans",
 ylab = "Data Value")

```


There is one observable outlier in fitness plan A and no outliers in B,C,D

Problem 2:

Is the data symmetrical or skewed for each group? Verify the normality assumption for ANOVA. (Hint: Find the Pearson’s moment coefficient of
skewness and justify it with probability distribution function plot or you can also plot the Q-Q plot)

```{r}
library(e1071)
```
```{r}
skewness_A <- skewness(data$A)
skewness_B <- skewness(data$B)
skewness_C <- skewness(data$C)
skewness_D <- skewness(data$D)
cat("Skewness for Group A:", skewness_A, "\n")
```
```{r}
cat("Skewness for Group B:", skewness_B, "\n")
```
```{r}
cat("Skewness for Group C:", skewness_C, "\n")

```
```{r}
cat("Skewness for Group D:", skewness_D, "\n")

```

```{r}
#Q-Q plot for Group A
qqnorm(data$A)
qqline(data$A, col = 2)

```


```{r}
#Q-Q plot for Group B
qqnorm(data$B)
qqline(data$B, col = 4)
```

```{r}
#Q-Q plot for Group C
qqnorm(data$C)
qqline(data$C, col = 7)
```
```{r}
#Q-Q plot for Group D
qqnorm(data$D)
qqline(data$D, col = 5)
```

We can conclude from the abovec result that the data for all groups are skewed and not symmetrical. Skewness for Group B: 0.009463167 is the least here.

Problem 3:
Is there any evidence to suggest a difference in the average marks obtained by students under different fitness plans? Explain what test are you using and why ? Define the hypothesis and the steps of testing. What does the output of this test signify ? (Note: Assume the significance level to be 0.05 

One way Anova test is used.

Step 1: Define Hypotheses Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the average marks obtained by students under different fitness plans (i.e., μA = μB = μC = μD). Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): There is a significant difference in the average marks obtained by students
under different fitness plans (i.e., at least one pair of means is different).

Step 2: Set the Significance Level Significance level is 0.05

Step 3: Perform the ANOVA Test aov function is used in R for the ANOVA test.

Step 4: Based on output i)If the p-value is less than α (e.g., p < 0.05), you would reject the null hypothesis (H0) and conclude that there is a significant difference in the average marks obtained by students under different fitness plans. ii)If the p-value is greater than or equal to α (e.g., p ≥ 0.05), you would fail to reject the null hypothesis, and you do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference among the fitness plans.


```{r}
library(reshape2)
```
```{r}
data_long <- melt(data)
```

```{r}
colnames(data_long) <- c("FitnessPlan", "Marks")
model <- aov(Marks ~ FitnessPlan, data = data_long)
anova_result <- summary(model)
print(anova_result)

```
We can see that the F-value here is 7.287 and the p value respectively is 9.1*10^(-5) Fcritical for alpha=0.05 is 3.101
Fstatistic>Fcritical and (p value)<(alpha value) Therefore we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the average marks obtained by students under different
fitness plans.

Two way ANOVA:


Problem 4:
Which specific task exhibits the lowest average training time? Does the combination of different treats and tasks significantly influence the training time for pets?

ANOVA for “Task”:

Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the mean ResponseTime across different tasks. 
Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): There is a significant difference in the mean ResponseTime across different tasks

ANOVA for “Treat”:
Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the mean ResponseTime across different treats.
Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): There is a significant difference in the mean ResponseTime across different treats.

```{r}
pet_data <- read_excel("C:/Users/Praka/OneDrive/Documents/5thSem/DA/pet_training.xlsx")
summary(pet_data)
```

```{r}
boxplot(ResponseTime ~ Task, data = pet_data)
```

```{r}
boxplot(ResponseTime ~ Treat, data = pet_data)
```

```{r}
# ANOVA for Task
task_anova <- aov(ResponseTime ~ Task, data = pet_data)
summary(task_anova)
```

```{r}
# ANOVA for Treat
treat_anova <- aov(ResponseTime ~ Treat, data = pet_data)
summary(treat_anova)
```

Here P value is below alpha which is 0.05 and Fstatistic(22.48)>Fcritical(3.101) Which indicates that there are significant differences. We can conclude the combination of different treats and tasks significantly influence the training time for pets.

Problem 5:

Does the choice of treats significantly impact the training time for different tasks? Which specific combinations of treats and tasks lead to the most significant differences in training time? (Note: Assume the significance level to be 0.05 )

```{r}
task_posthoc <- TukeyHSD(task_anova)
print(task_posthoc)

```

```{r}
treat_posthoc <- TukeyHSD(treat_anova)
print(treat_posthoc)
```


Based on this post hoc analysis: Task B and Task D have the lowest average ResponseTime Treat III has the highest average ResponseTime,
while Treat I and Treat II have similar and lower average ResponseTimes.

In conclusion, Task B has the lowest average ResponseTime among the tasks, and Treat II has the lowest average ResponseTime among the
treats






































































Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
